# Six-Puzzle
This small project considers a variant of the eight-puzzle, where the size is reduced to 3x2 in order to keep the number of states manageable.

The goal of the project is the solve the six-puzzle of size 3x2 by considering the following initial state and goal state:

Initial state: [[1,4,2],[5,3,0]]
Goal state: [[0,1,2],[5,4,3]]

Breadth first search, uniform cost search, depth first search and iterative deepening are implemented to observe their behaviour. 

An example output from Breadth First search is given below:
