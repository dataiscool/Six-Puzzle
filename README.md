# Six-Puzzle
This small project considers a variant of the eight-puzzle, where the size is reduced to 3x2 in order to keep the number of states manageable.

The goal of the project is the solve the six-puzzle of size 3x2 by considering the following initial state and goal state:

Initial state: [[1,4,2],[5,3,0]]
Goal state: [[0,1,2],[5,4,3]]

For this project, I implemented four different algorithms: Breadth first search, uniform cost search, depth first search and iterative deepening to observe the sequence of steps in which each solves the puzzle.

An example output from Breadth First search is given below:
